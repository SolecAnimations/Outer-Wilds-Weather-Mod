# Outer-Wilds-Weather-Mod
A mod for Outer Wilds of the sorts of Subnautica's Weather mod, adding weather scattered across the star system.

As any planet mod, this requires New Horizons.

Current weather: Sand tornadoes on the Hourglass Twins, Rain on Timber Hearth, Clouds on Brittle Hollow (i could not make the snow work for the life of me), And atmosphere and snow on Dark Bramble.
